### LOAN-06: Edit Loan (Edit Basic Information)

**Goal**: Edit basic information of loan (name, bank, note) after starting payments.

**Steps**:
1. Go to loan details
2. Tap **Edit** (only edit name, note, bank)
3. Edit:
   - Loan Name: "Home Loan - Downtown Apartment - Unit A1-1201"
   - (Optional) Change bank: HDFC Bank
   - Note: "Transferred to new bank"
4. View disabled fields: Loan Amount, Disbursement Date, Term, Interest Rate
5. Tap **Save**

**Result**: Basic information updated, other information unchanged.

**Note**: If loan has no payments made yet, can edit all information (amount, term, interest configuration).

## 6. Logic & Rules

### 6.1 Promotional/Floating Rate

- Can have promotional period (lower interest rate)
- After promotional period, interest rate floats by period
- Each period can be **Floating** (market-based) or **Fixed**

### 6.2 Late Payment Penalties

- Penalties calculated by %/year
- Can configure differently for each period
- Penalties only apply when payment is late

### 6.3 Payment Schedule

- App automatically creates payment schedule based on:
  - Loan amount
  - Interest rate
  - Term
- Each payment period includes: Principal + Interest

### 6.4 Early Settlement

- Calculate remaining amount (principal + interest + penalties if any)
- After settlement, loan will change to "Completed" status

### 6.5 Notifications

- App sends reminder notification when payment is due
- Notification time can be configured for each loan (`notificationTime1`, `notificationTime2`, default 10:00 and 19:00)

## 7. Important Notes

- **Complex Interest Rates**: This module supports interest rates that change by period, requires careful configuration
- **Cannot delete when payment schedule exists**: If payment schedule exists, you can only settle, cannot delete
- **Early Settlement**: May require additional penalty fees, depends on bank policy
- **Payment Schedule**: Payment schedule is calculated automatically, you cannot edit directly
